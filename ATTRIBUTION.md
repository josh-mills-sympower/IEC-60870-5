## About the Original Project

j60870 is a Java implementation of the IEC 60870-5 protocol standard for industrial automation and SCADA systems, originally developed by the OpenMUC team at Fraunhofer ISE. The original library provided support for TCP/IP (IEC 60870-5-104).

## Changes Made in This Fork

This fork, provides limited support for the IEC 60870-5-101 protocol, which is used for serial communication in SCADA systems.

## License Compliance

This fork maintains the same **GNU General Public License v3.0** as the original project, in compliance with the copyleft requirements. All modifications are clearly documented and attributed.

## Acknowledgments

We thank the OpenMUC team and Fraunhofer ISE for their excellent work on the original j60870 library, which provided the foundation for this enhanced implementation.
